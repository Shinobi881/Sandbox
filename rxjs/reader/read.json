Their song “These Walls” won the Grammy award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2016 Grammy’s. Anna also performs alongside her band, Sonnymoon, with whom she has released three albums, Golden Age, Sonnymoon, and The Courage of Present Times. Anna has shared the stage with artists such as Kendrick Lamar, Kimbra, The Roots, Givers, Flying Lotus, Bilal, Teebs, Tei Shi, and more. Anna’s first EP, The Feminine: Act I, is now available for purchase and streaming online.\n\n\nNaytronix BIO:\nStrangers to the touring life refer to it as “living the dream,” while generally the ones actually doing the touring see it more as living in a dream. The difference is subtle to the uninitiated, yet is intimate to Nate Brenner, AKA Naytronix, who has spent much of the past four years touring the world as bassist for the mighty tUnE-yArDs.

                "text": "SIZZLA\n with support from  SMOKE1 DJ I-VIER\nFriday September 23rd / 9pm - 2am / 21+\n\n\n\n\nSIZZLA \nFacebook  Twitter  Soundcloud\nSizzla Kalonji is one of the most prolific leaders of the conscious Reggae dancehall movement. Emerging in the latter half of the 90s, he helped lead dancehall back to the musical and spiritual influence of roots reggae and heavily Rastafarian subject matter. He was born Miguel Collins on April 17, 1976 in St Mary and was raised in the community of August Town. The 1980's witnessed a dancehall explosion, and with the music came the lifestyle. Sizzla watched carefully, collecting his lyrical ammunition. He began his career in the music industry in his early teenage years. After honing his vocal skills, he landed a gig with the Caveman Hi-Fi sound system, where he first made a name for himself as a performer. He cut his first single for the small Zagalou label in 1995, and soon moved on to Fattis “Exterminator” Burrell.   Extensive touring with fellow roots and culture artist Luciano followed, earning Sizzla critical acclaim. Working with Fattis marked an important turning point for Sizzla. From the outset their relationship was one of mutual respect and Inspiration. A run of successful singles led to the release of Sizzla's debut album, 'Burning Up' (RAS). The alliance again proved fruitful a year later with the follow-up, 'Praise Ye Jah' (JetStar). Securing his position as a top conscious reggae artist, he set about cultivating his role as a spiritual messenger. Sizzla's combination of Rasta principles and up-to-the-minute dancehall rhythms made his hard line approach more palatable. A brilliant and passionate performer, Sizzla broke boundaries, appealing to those looking for something new, music with depth. His major breakthrough came with the release in 1997 of the now classic album, 'Black Woman and Child' (Greensleeves). Bearing all the hallmarks of Bobby 'Digital' Dixon's dancehall-influenced production, the impact on both the reggae and mainstream markets was phenomenal. The evocative title track, issued as a single, rapidly achieved anthemic status. Along with universal praise came Sizzla's first nomination for Best International Reggae Artist of the Year at the 1998 MOBO Awards and a place in various magazines' top 100 albums of the year.   Sizzla scored several more hits during 1997, including ‘Like Mountain’, ‘Babylon Cowboy,’ ‘Kings of the Earth,’ and the Luciano duet ‘Build a Better World.’ This hot streak kicked off an enormously productive recording binge that has lasted for years. He has an ability to fuse passionate lyrical styling with deceptively simple rhythms that take in range of genres from staccato dancehall and gentle roots reggae to surprisingly commercial R&B and soul arrangements. Overall his music is generally positive, advocating faith, compassion for poor black youth, and respect for women. He remains something of an enigma to the public at large, rarely granting interviews and keeping his concert appearances to a minimum. Nonetheless, he still ranks as arguably the most popular conscious reggae artist of his time. A versatile singjay-style vocalist with a gruff, gravelly tone, he is capable of both rapid fire chatting, powerful, melodic singing, and his best backing riddims are among the strongest in contemporary dancehall. Sizzla Kalonji has released over 46 impressive solo albums and over fifteen combination albums, crossing different genres of Reggae. The number of mix tapes on the street are countless. He also started his own company Kalonji Records; this set the mark of his growth not only as a great reggae artist but also a record label executive and businessman. In a joint venture with Kalonji Records, his most recent album The Overstanding was released in November 2006 with Damon Dash Music Group and Koch Records. It is as prolific, infectious, and melodic as the previous albums. This is his third album released through Kalonji Records; as well as ‘Black History’ and ‘Life’. Sizzla Kalonji continues to release music through his career showcasing the level of talent that exudes through his creativity. In addition to his musical breakthroughs, Sizzla continues to build different business opportunities to empower himself and the community by creating an environment for young people to grow and develop skills.\n\nSizzla - Thank You Mama\nPlays: 4,143,674\n\n9pm doors / 10pm show",

Quik who performs in the Bay annually to sold out or near sold out attendance will be bringing his live band.Since the Platinum selling Quik is the Name hit stores in 1991, DJ Quik has carved a well defined and respected niche in the rap game. With four gold and platinum albums and production work with 2Pac, Talib Kweli, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Janet Jackson, Tony, Toni, Tone and Dr. Dre to his credit, DJ Quik stands as one of hip-hop's most consistent artists and musicians. With a slew of Billboard Awards under his belt, this Compton, California native set the bar high for street oriented hip-hop, raising the standard with well crafted production and dense musicianship. His lyrics are always honest and straightforward and his beats stay dense and funky.Considering his conspicuous beginnings as a gangster rapper, Quik, a natural musician and beatmaker, eventually transformed himself into a funk driven band leader and front man. Because of this, he has an unusually varied fanbase, from die-hard roughneck rap devotees to the most erudite backpackers and everything in-between. Quik discovered Suga Free and then produced Suga Free’s 1997 debut album, Street Gospel. Five other albums have followed, solidifying Suga Free’s status as a street legend. Suga Free’s entire career is best described as a pimp guidebook set to beats. Suga Free will be joining Quik and his live band on stage for their first joint performance in the Bay Area where both artists have a deep and loyal following.\n\nMEDIA SUPPORT BY :\nJE MEDIA | BLACK MONTHLY | KBLX | Q102 | HIP HOP FROM WAY BACK | ELECTRIK HONEY \nOFFICIAL EVENTS | OFFICIAL LADIES | SEAN HEALY PRESENTS + MORE \n\nFEATURINGDJ OUMA(TIGHT FADE ENT, HIP HOP SINCE WAY BACK, BAYLIFE)&  CJ FLASH\n(WORLD FAMOUS RICK AND RUSS SHOW, KBLX)\nMIXING LIVE INSIDE GRAND LIVE AT VENUE OAKLAND(3rd Floor)+DJ TRUTH(OFFICIAL DJS) MIXING LIVE INSIDE VINYL NIGHTCLUB/LOUNGE AT VENUE OAKLAND(2nd Floor)\nOPENING ACT:\nDawnari \nPLUS SPECIAL PROMOTIONS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT!\n \nNO REFUNDS Ticket Transfer Policy: If you would like to have someone else claim your will-call spot, you MUST provide them with a photo copy of your driver’s license or credit card used to purchase the tickets, along with a signed note authorizing them to use your spot (specify quantity).  Without proof and written consent, they will not be admitted inside the venue.\n",

Holiday's second album, the more romantic Round 2, was released in March 2009.

The bonus track from the EP was just released, and it was featured on Thizzler.com and Bay Area Compass as a featured single. \r\nErk Tha Jerk will be taking over Oakland's Venue Oakland, performing his smash hits including \"Hands up\" and \"Right Here\"\r\n \r\nFAQs\r\nWhen should I arrive to the event?\r\nWe ask that guests arrive between 8:00-9:30 pm to ensure a quick entry into the venue. We stop accepting tickets at 10:30 pm, so please make it to the door by then. \r\n \r\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\r\nThis is a 18 + Event, ID is required. No exceptions.\r\nIs there a Dress Code for this Event?\r\nYes.\r\nDO NOT WEAR:\r\nHats, Baggy clothing, Sports Attire, Plain T-shirts, Face and/or Neck Tattoos.\r\nDO WEAR:\r\nCollard Shirts, Fitted Pants\r\nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?\r\nYes\r\n \r\nWhat is the refund policy?\r\nWe will refund your ticket within 24 hour of purchase.\r\n \r\nErk's Bio\r\n \r\n\r\nErk Tha Jerk is not your every day, ordinary rap artist. In an era where the majority of artists are all sounding the same, looking the same, and doing the same things, Erk stands out as a real one of a kind artist. At first glance, you would not assume that Erk was a rapper/producer/songwriter, but with his trademark glasses, wit, and laid back persona, he brings something that your average music listener can embrace and relate to. He explains, “Being myself is a must. That’s the kind of music I make. Real sh*t. I don’t feel the same everyday. Some days I’m on my get money sh*t, then the next I’m on my chill at home sh*t. I just make sure everybody can relate”.\r\nErk found that finding credible production to accompany his lyrics would not be an easy task, which led him to start teaching himself the art of making beats. After some time, Erk’s production talents had become quite formidable, and he produced all of his own work, and other artists began seeking him out to produce their work as well.\r\nEven though his status as a producer was growing, his heart has always been in his raps. In late 2007, he dropped “The Hood Nerd” mixtape, which created some buzz around him as an artist, and got the streets talking. The song “Dont need Em” became a favorite of DJ’s and listeners, and has been getting significant plays on 106.1 KMEL. In order to capitalize off the building buzz, Erk released “The Hood Nerd EP” exclusively on Itunes featuring the hit song “Dont Need Em”, which is a precursor to an upcoming album, which is in the making. In June 2008, Erk released “Im So Dumb” which is a witty, comedic song satirizing the “Hyphy Movement”, and effectively pronouncing it dead. The song has been receiving praise from all over the region for its blunt honesty, and has been considered a long overdue message by many of the most powerful figures and artists in the local scene.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn 2009, Erk collaborated with Bay Area Legend Too $hort on the single “Plane in the air”. Also in 2009, Erk struck gold by dropping his HIT Single “Right Here” which quickly shot to the number 1 spot on 106KMEL’s playlist. “Right Here” became one of the biggest records for the Bay Area from a Bay Area Artist the region has seen in years, further establishing his ability to make hit songs. Recently charting on Billboards top 100 and recognized by MTV as having a “Regional Hit”. His lyrical talents and vibrant personality are evident in the song, and has every one talking about Erk Tha Jerk. You can expect Erk to do what he does best, “Make hit music for real people”",

Something. Anything. To that end, she creates lush, emotionally-driven folk rock bursting with an honest, earnest energy that easily convinces you to lash your heartstrings to her dock. Comparisons include Stevie Nicks, Ingrid Michaelson, and Feist, and these talents have clearly lent inspiration as well.\nThunderegg: Half San Francisco, half Oakland, all rock, Thunderegg has recorded nearly 20 albums since 1994. Influenced by the Velvet Underground, Neil Young, and Guided by Voices, the Egg combines simple, melodic tunes with sharp lyrics and averages more than one amplifier per guitar. Check out their latest 7″ at thunderegg.bandcamp.com.\nOn Dolphin: After years of playing solo acoustic shows, Melissa Lyn dusted off her electric guitar and teamed up with her husband, engineer and producer Ryan Clark to create on dolphin's debut full length album LAYERS to be released on vinyl July 22, 2016.\nMaximillian: Aggressively-pleasant melodic indie rock from Berkeley California. Pop forms and melodies give way to distorted hypnotic guitar-grooves and electronic noise flourishes. Started as a solo project by Max, Maximillian is now a 4-piece rock band.",

After years of performing as a gritty two-piece, Grigor and Israel decided to bring in additional musicians to pursue a more fully realized sound. Bassist Eric Mai and lead guitarist/keyboardist Jordan Griggs (The Cushion Theory)  joined the band in 2013 and shortly thereafter, the group began writing songs and recorded their debut full-length, Truth & Consequence which was released in July 2014. \nThe Shams: The Shams began in 2011 in San Francisco, lead by energetic and charismatic front man Sean Daly, from Donegal, Ireland. In the last year, The Shams released their award-winning EP \"One and All\", embarked on a Northwest tour and sold out the legendary Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. The Shams are quickly becoming a fan-favorite by combining their hard rocking, punked-up beat and raw, powerful vocals. Their repertoire of original songs reach deep down into their rebel roots and pulls out incredibly original tracks that illuminate what it means to be Irish. They provide listeners with a new, hard-hitting perspective on the evolution of Irish music, unlike any you’ve heard before. With each fiery live performance, The Shams are leaving listeners begging for more.\nSweetwater Black: \"Sweetwater Black is a Bay Area based trio that reflects influences from bands like the Black Keys and Black Sabbath.

The masters of these rhythms say there are over 40 different variations of Dundunbahs. Dundunbah has been used at times of conflict between villages to prepare frontline warriors; it is also played to welcome new comers and as a send off to visitors to the village.\nWe are learning Dundunbah now to assist us in moving through the conflicts presented as we move towards racial, gender, and environmental equity. The complexity of Dundunbah requires our attention to the subtle shifts and variations- training us for responding to the subtle changes needed in our liberation movements. \nArtistic Director of Spirit Drumz, Afia Walking Tree: Educator, Facilitator, and Ritualist, Afia Walking Tree, M.Ed is a world-class cultural ambassador, spiritual activist, empowerment guide, leadership development advocate and trainer. Born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, she is currently based in the California Bay Area. Walking Tree’s drum-songs are prayers of gratitude for the generosity of spirit. Her lyrics are evolutionary teachings, addressing present day issues of social justice, freedom, healing and self-love.

An honors graduate of the Berklee College of Music, Dmitri Matheny vaulted onto the jazz scene in the 1990s as the protégé of jazz legend Art Farmer. Since then he has garnered critical acclaim and a loyal international following, touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe and Asia, traveling to 19 countries. The San Francisco Chronicle calls Matheny “one of the jazz world’s most talented horn players.”\nThe Dmitri Matheny Group featuring Matt Clark will showcase selections from their new album JAZZ NOIR, a fresh spin on crime jazz, film noir and timeless classics. “Their music is a fertile landscape without boundaries,” writes the Oakland Tribune, “earning Matheny and his cohorts a reputation as one of the most eclectic and daring ensembles on today’s jazz scene.” All About Jazz agrees: “An all-star jazz band featuring some of the most accomplished musicians in the western United States, the Dmitri Matheny Group is a cohesive and seamless unit, serving up equal parts soulful expression, caressing phrases, imaginative asides, and dedicated lyricism.”\nhttp://www.dmitrimatheny.com",

Her debut album was released in 2010 and since then, has garnered critical acclaim and press coverage from VIBE, 2DopeBoyz.com, Refinery29, and numerous music blogs across the web.\r\nIn 2012, Rocky became the only female artist at the VIBE HOUSE’s Respect The West Showcase at the SXSW Festival, sharing the stage with West Coast favorites such as Nipsey Hussle, Strong Arm Steady, Snoop Dog and Kendrick Lamar.\r\n \r\nCamille Safiya -  Camille Safiya is an artist in the purest form.  From an accomplished painter, to pushing out amazing music, she creates to touch lives.  Camille Safiya is for the people, for the most common woman to the most intricate personality.  As a young revolutionary spirit she grew up traveling the world with her mother's Feminist movement, protesting again domestic violence and global civil rights issues before she could even walk.  Her music today is a melting pot of all she's learned from her family and world travels.   \r\n \r\nBabii Cris -Babii Cris is a twenty-two year old emcee, sound engineer, and producer from San Francisco, CA. Her music is individualized as her own combination of West Coast, boom bap beats, alternative hip hop, and conscious rap.  Raised by single teenage parents, Babii Cris grew up bobbing her head to nineties hip hop and early millennium artists such as Eminem, Alicia Keys, TLC, Bone Thugs N Harmony, The Fugees, Amanda Perez, NB Ridaz, Outkast, and many more. \r\n \r\nXiomara -  For Berkeley, California native, Xiomara, music is not just a choice - it's a calling.  Her unique sound was born under diverse influences, ranging from Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythms to Jazz and Classical masterpieces.  Xiomara's avenues of expression range just as broadly: whether her own composition, taking the lead on a cover, as resident artist on a Hip-Hop recording, or inspiring a community protest in song, Xiomara infuses her every offering with a powerful, raw emotion.  \r\n \r\nChhoti Maa - CHHOTI MAA was born out of a tradition of migrants in Guanajuato and forced by the Mexican post-NAFTA exodus into movement. Her raps have roots in her grandmothers poetic recitation and in Mexican oral tradition. She developed through poetry and got training in gospel and soul singing in Albany, Georgia. CHHOTI MAA’s music deals with decolonial living, migrant swag and reconstructing the womyn temple. CHHOTI MAA is a cultural producer-organizer, educator, bruja, writer and artist. \r\n \r\nCome support and enjoy incredible local music and women artists - free admission! This is a 21 plus show.\r\n  \r\nLocal Sirens is made possible through support from California Arts Council, Zellerbach Family Foundation, and Phyllis C. Wattis Foundation. Come spend your evening with WAM and enjoy free live music!\r\n \r\n\r\n",
